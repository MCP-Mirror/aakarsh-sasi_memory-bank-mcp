# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the development of the Memory Bank MCP.

## Automated NPM Publication

- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project requires manual version bumping and tag creation to trigger NPM publication, which can lead to delays in releasing updates and potential human errors.
- **Decision:** Modify the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically publish a new version to NPM whenever there's a merge to the main branch, with automatic patch version increments.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keeping the manual tag-based release process, Using a separate release management tool, Implementing a scheduled release cycle
- **Consequences:** Faster and more consistent release cycle, Reduced manual intervention, Automatic version management, Potential for more frequent releases

## Memory Bank Recognition Investigation

- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The Memory Bank MCP tools are having trouble recognizing the existing Memory Bank directory, which prevents proper updating and management of the Memory Bank files.
- **Decision:** Investigate the root cause of the recognition issues and implement a fix to ensure the Memory Bank tools can properly recognize and interact with the existing Memory Bank directory.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Creating a new Memory Bank directory, Manually updating Memory Bank files without using the tools
- **Consequences:** Improved reliability of Memory Bank tools, Better user experience when managing Memory Bank files, Consistent behavior across different environments

## Configuration for npx usage

- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project needs to be configured to be executed via npx after publication on npm.
- **Decision:** Implement the necessary configurations to allow execution via npx, including bin configuration in package.json, shebang verification, and appropriate documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Not offering npx support and focusing only on global installation, Creating a separate script for npx execution
- **Consequences:** Ease of use without installation required, Better experience for users who prefer to test before installing, Clearer documentation about usage options

## Memory Bank Path Configuration

- **Date:** 2025-03-08 1:56:18 AM
- **Context:** The Memory Bank was not being correctly recognized by the MCP. We needed to configure the correct path for the Memory Bank.
- **Decision:** We configured the Memory Bank path to /Users/movibe/Documents/Cline/MCP/memory-bank-server/memory-bank using the mcp\_\_set_memory_bank_path command.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Initialize a new Memory Bank
  - Migrate existing files to a new directory
  - Modify the code to recognize the existing directory
- **Consequences:**
  - The Memory Bank is now correctly recognized by the MCP
  - All existing files are available and working
  - No need to create or migrate files
  - Resolved the Memory Bank recognition issue listed in known issues

## Using Current Directory as Default for Memory Bank

- **Date:** 2025-03-08 2:04:16 AM
- **Context:** When the user doesn't specify a path for the Memory Bank, the system needs to decide which directory to use as default.
- **Decision:** We modified the project to use the current directory (process.cwd()) as default when no path is specified for the Memory Bank.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Use a fixed directory as default
  - Require the user to always specify a path
  - Use the user's home directory as default
- **Consequences:**
  - Greater ease of use, as the user doesn't need to specify a path
  - More intuitive behavior, as the Memory Bank is created in the current directory
  - Compatibility with previous behavior, as the path parameter is still accepted
  - Better experience for new users who are experimenting with the system

## English Language Standardization for Memory Bank

- **Date:** 2025-03-08 2:04:23 AM
- **Context:** The Memory Bank needs to have a standard language to ensure consistency across different environments and for different users.
- **Decision:** We modified the project to always generate the Memory Bank in English, regardless of the system locale.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Use the operating system language
  - Allow the user to choose the language
  - Automatically detect the language based on existing content
- **Consequences:**
  - Greater consistency across different environments
  - Ease of collaboration between users from different countries
  - Compatibility with tools and systems that expect English content
  - Simplification of code, as there's no need to handle multiple languages

## Implementation of Semantic Versioning with Changelog Generation
- **Date:** 2025-03-08 2:10:24 AM
- **Context:** The project needed a standardized approach to versioning and a way to automatically generate a changelog based on commit messages.
- **Decision:** Implemented Semantic Versioning with automatic changelog generation using standard-version in the GitHub Actions workflow for npm publish.
- **Alternatives Considered:** 
  - Manual version management
  - Using a different versioning tool like semantic-release
  - Not using automatic versioning at all
- **Consequences:** 
  - Automatic version bumping based on commit message types
  - Standardized changelog generation
  - Better documentation of changes for users
  - Enforced commit message format for contributors
  - Simplified release process
