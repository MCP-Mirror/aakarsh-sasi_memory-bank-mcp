# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the development of the Memory Bank MCP.

## Memory Bank Recognition Investigation

- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The Memory Bank MCP tools are having trouble recognizing the existing Memory Bank directory, which prevents proper updating and management of the Memory Bank files.
- **Decision:** Investigate the root cause of the recognition issues and implement a fix to ensure the Memory Bank tools can properly recognize and interact with the existing Memory Bank directory.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Creating a new Memory Bank directory, Manually updating Memory Bank files without using the tools
- **Consequences:** Improved reliability of Memory Bank tools, Better user experience when managing Memory Bank files, Consistent behavior across different environments

## Configuration for npx usage

- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project needs to be configured to be executed via npx after publication on npm.
- **Decision:** Implement the necessary configurations to allow execution via npx, including bin configuration in package.json, shebang verification, and appropriate documentation.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Not offering npx support and focusing only on global installation, Creating a separate script for npx execution
- **Consequences:** Ease of use without installation required, Better experience for users who prefer to test before installing, Clearer documentation about usage options
