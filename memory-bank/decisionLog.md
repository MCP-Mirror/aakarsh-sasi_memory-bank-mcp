# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the development of the Memory Bank MCP.

## Code Translation and Improvement

- **Date:** 2023-03-08 12:00:00
- **Context:** The codebase was initially written in Portuguese and needed improvements in error handling and documentation.
- **Decision:** Translate all code to English and improve error handling, documentation, and add additional utility methods.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the code in Portuguese
  - Only translate comments and documentation
  - Only improve error handling without translation
- **Consequences:**
  - Improved code readability for international developers
  - Better error handling for more robust operation
  - More comprehensive documentation
  - Additional utility methods for better functionality
  - Improved type safety with interfaces

## Build Configuration with Bun

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 12:45:00
- **Context:** The project was using TypeScript's tsc for building, which is slower than alternatives.
- **Decision:** Configure the build process to use Bun for improved performance.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Continue using tsc
  - Use esbuild directly
  - Use swc
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster build times
  - Better development experience with hot reloading
  - Improved runtime performance
  - More modern build configuration
  - Better compatibility with ESM

## Project Rename

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 17:00:00
- **Context:** The project needed a more specific name that follows npm scoped package naming conventions.
- **Decision:** Rename the project from "memory-bank-server" to "@movibe/memory-bank-mcp".
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the current name
  - Use a different naming convention
  - Use a different scope
- **Consequences:**
  - Better alignment with npm scoped package naming conventions
  - More specific name that reflects the project's purpose
  - Improved discoverability on npm
  - Clear indication that it's an MCP server
  - Consistent naming across documentation and code

## Testing Framework Selection

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 22:40:00
- **Context:** The project needed automated tests for the clinerules integration, and a testing framework had to be selected.
- **Decision:** Use Bun's built-in test runner instead of Jest or other testing frameworks.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Jest
  - Mocha + Chai
  - Vitest
  - AVA
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster test execution with Bun's test runner
  - Simplified setup without additional dependencies
  - Consistent tooling (using Bun for both building and testing)
  - Better integration with the Bun ecosystem
  - Reduced configuration complexity
## Test Framework Selection
- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project needed a testing framework for implementing automated tests. We had to choose between Jest, Mocha, and Bun's built-in test runner.
- **Decision:** Use Bun's built-in test runner for all tests.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Jest - Popular testing framework with extensive features, Mocha + Chai - Flexible testing framework with separate assertion library, Vitest - Fast testing framework compatible with Vite, AVA - Minimalist testing framework
- **Consequences:** Faster test execution with Bun's test runner, Simplified setup without additional dependencies, Consistent tooling (using Bun for both building and testing), Better integration with the Bun ecosystem, Reduced configuration complexity, Some limitations compared to more mature frameworks like Jest
