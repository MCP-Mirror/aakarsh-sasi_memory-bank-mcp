# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the development of the Memory Bank MCP.

## Code Translation and Improvement

- **Date:** 2023-03-08 12:00:00
- **Context:** The codebase was initially written in Portuguese and needed improvements in error handling and documentation.
- **Decision:** Translate all code to English and improve error handling, documentation, and add additional utility methods.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the code in Portuguese
  - Only translate comments and documentation
  - Only improve error handling without translation
- **Consequences:**
  - Improved code readability for international developers
  - Better error handling for more robust operation
  - More comprehensive documentation
  - Additional utility methods for better functionality
  - Improved type safety with interfaces

## Build Configuration with Bun

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 12:45:00
- **Context:** The project was using TypeScript's tsc for building, which is slower than alternatives.
- **Decision:** Configure the build process to use Bun for improved performance.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Continue using tsc
  - Use esbuild directly
  - Use swc
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster build times
  - Better development experience with hot reloading
  - Improved runtime performance
  - More modern build configuration
  - Better compatibility with ESM

## Project Rename

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 17:00:00
- **Context:** The project needed a more specific name that follows npm scoped package naming conventions.
- **Decision:** Rename the project from "memory-bank-server" to "@movibe/memory-bank-mcp".
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the current name
  - Use a different naming convention
  - Use a different scope
- **Consequences:**
  - Better alignment with npm scoped package naming conventions
  - More specific name that reflects the project's purpose
  - Improved discoverability on npm
  - Clear indication that it's an MCP server
  - Consistent naming across documentation and code

## Testing Framework Selection

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 22:40:00
- **Context:** The project needed automated tests for the clinerules integration, and a testing framework had to be selected.
- **Decision:** Use Bun's built-in test runner instead of Jest or other testing frameworks.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Jest
  - Mocha + Chai
  - Vitest
  - AVA
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster test execution with Bun's test runner
  - Simplified setup without additional dependencies
  - Consistent tooling (using Bun for both building and testing)
  - Better integration with the Bun ecosystem
  - Reduced configuration complexity
## Test Framework Selection
- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project needed a testing framework for implementing automated tests. We had to choose between Jest, Mocha, and Bun's built-in test runner.
- **Decision:** Use Bun's built-in test runner for all tests.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Jest - Popular testing framework with extensive features, Mocha + Chai - Flexible testing framework with separate assertion library, Vitest - Fast testing framework compatible with Vite, AVA - Minimalist testing framework
- **Consequences:** Faster test execution with Bun's test runner, Simplified setup without additional dependencies, Consistent tooling (using Bun for both building and testing), Better integration with the Bun ecosystem, Reduced configuration complexity, Some limitations compared to more mature frameworks like Jest

## AI Assistant Integration Documentation
- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** Need to document how Memory Bank MCP can be integrated with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Decision:** Create comprehensive documentation for AI assistant integration, including integration methods, testing guides, and protocol specification.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Document only basic API integration, Focus only on specific AI assistants like Claude, Provide minimal integration examples without testing guides, Wait until implementation is complete before documenting
- **Consequences:** Developers have complete information needed for integration, Documentation covers multiple integration approaches, Testing guides ensure proper integration validation, Protocol specification provides clear understanding of the API, Documentation can guide implementation of AI assistant integration, Future AI assistants can be integrated using the same documentation

## Documentation Structure Consolidation
- **Date:** 2025-03-08
- **Context:** The project had documentation split between two directories: /docs and /memory-bank/docs, which was causing confusion and making it difficult to find information.
- **Decision:** Consolidate all documentation into a single /docs directory with a comprehensive README.md that organizes documentation by category.
- **Alternatives Considered:** Keep separate documentation directories for different aspects of the project, Move all documentation to /memory-bank/docs instead, Create a new documentation structure with subdirectories for each category, Use a documentation generator tool instead of markdown files
- **Consequences:** Simplified documentation structure makes it easier to find information, Single source of truth for all documentation, Easier maintenance with all documentation in one place, Clearer organization with categorized documentation in the README.md, Better developer experience with consistent documentation location, Reduced duplication of information
