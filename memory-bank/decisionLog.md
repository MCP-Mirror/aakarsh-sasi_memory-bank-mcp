# Decision Log

This document tracks important decisions made during the development of the Memory Bank MCP.

## Code Translation and Improvement

- **Date:** 2023-03-08 12:00:00
- **Context:** The codebase was initially written in Portuguese and needed improvements in error handling and documentation.
- **Decision:** Translate all code to English and improve error handling, documentation, and add additional utility methods.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the code in Portuguese
  - Only translate comments and documentation
  - Only improve error handling without translation
- **Consequences:**
  - Improved code readability for international developers
  - Better error handling for more robust operation
  - More comprehensive documentation
  - Additional utility methods for better functionality
  - Improved type safety with interfaces

## Build Configuration with Bun

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 12:45:00
- **Context:** The project was using TypeScript's tsc for building, which is slower than alternatives.
- **Decision:** Configure the build process to use Bun for improved performance.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Continue using tsc
  - Use esbuild directly
  - Use swc
- **Consequences:**
  - Faster build times
  - Better development experience with hot reloading
  - Improved runtime performance
  - More modern build configuration
  - Better compatibility with ESM

## Project Rename

- **Date:** 2024-03-08 17:00:00
- **Context:** The project needed a more specific name that follows npm scoped package naming conventions.
- **Decision:** Rename the project from "memory-bank-server" to "@movibe/memory-bank-mcp".
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Keep the current name
  - Use a different naming convention
  - Use a different scope
- **Consequences:**
  - Better alignment with npm scoped package naming conventions
  - More specific name that reflects the project's purpose
  - Improved discoverability on npm
  - Clear indication that it's an MCP server
  - Consistent naming across documentation and code
