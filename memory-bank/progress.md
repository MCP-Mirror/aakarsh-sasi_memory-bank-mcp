## Update History

- [2025-03-08 2:17:30 AM] - Aprimoramento da Documentação: Atualizei o README.md para inglês, adicionei emojis em todas as seções para melhorar a apresentação visual e incluí uma nova seção detalhada sobre os diferentes modos do MCP (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug e Test) com instruções sobre como usar e alternar entre eles.
- [2025-03-08 2:15:54 AM] - Atualização da Documentação para uso do npx: Atualizei o README.md e o docs/cursor-integration.md para usar npx em vez de instalação global do pacote Memory Bank MCP. Isso simplifica o processo de instalação e configuração para os usuários do Cursor, eliminando a necessidade de instalar o pacote globalmente.
- [2025-03-08 2:14:00 AM] - Added Cursor Integration Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation for integrating Memory Bank MCP with Cursor. Added a detailed cursor-integration.md guide with configuration steps, usage examples, workflow examples, troubleshooting tips, and best practices. Updated the main README.md with a link to the new documentation and enhanced the docs/README.md index to include the new guide.
- [2025-03-08 2:12:42 AM] - Enhanced README Documentation: Enhanced the README.md with comprehensive information about configuring Memory Bank MCP in Cursor, detailed explanations of how the MCP works, core components, data flow, Memory Bank structure, advanced features, and usage examples both as a command-line tool and as a library.
- [2025-03-08 2:10:24 AM] - Decision Made: Implementation of Semantic Versioning with Changelog Generation
- [2025-03-08 2:10:18 AM] - Added Versioning with Changelog Generation: Added automatic versioning with changelog generation to the GitHub Actions workflow for npm publish. Implemented Semantic Versioning and Conventional Commits for better version management. Created initial CHANGELOG.md, .versionrc.json configuration, and updated documentation with commit message guidelines.
- [2025-03-08 2:06:48 AM] - English Translation of Memory Bank Files: Translated all remaining Portuguese content in the Memory Bank files to English. This includes entries in decision-log.md, progress.md, active-context.md, and modular-architecture-proposal.md. Also updated a comment in CoreTools.ts to English.
- [2025-03-08 2:04:23 AM] - Decision Made: English Language Standardization for Memory Bank
- [2025-03-08 2:04:16 AM] - Decision Made: Using Current Directory as Default for Memory Bank
- [2025-03-08 2:04:09 AM] - Memory Bank Language Configuration: We modified the project to always generate the Memory Bank in English, regardless of the system locale. We added a language property to the MemoryBankManager class and updated the templates to ensure they are always in English.
- [2025-03-08 2:04:05 AM] - Memory Bank Path Update: We modified the project so that if no folder is specified for the Memory Bank, it uses the current project folder. We changed the setCustomPath and handleSetMemoryBankPath methods to accept optional parameters and use the current directory as default.
- [2025-03-08 1:56:18 AM] - Decision Made: Memory Bank Path Configuration
- [2025-03-08 1:55:57 AM] - Memory Bank Configuration: We successfully configured the Memory Bank path to /Users/movibe/Documents/Cline/MCP/memory-bank-server/memory-bank. We verified that all core files are present and the Memory Bank is working correctly.
- [2025-03-08] - NPM Publication: Successfully published the @movibe/memory-bank-mcp package version 0.1.0 to the npm registry. The package is now available for global installation and can be run as a command-line tool. Verified that the package works correctly when installed globally.
- [2025-03-08] - GitHub Actions Workflow Update: Modified the npm-publish.yml workflow to automatically publish a new version to NPM whenever there's a merge to the main branch. Added auto-increment version functionality that bumps the patch version before publishing. This ensures that the package is always up-to-date on NPM without requiring manual version bumps and tag creation.
- [2025-03-08] - Memory Bank Update: Attempted to update the Memory Bank system. Identified that the Memory Bank files already exist in the memory-bank directory but the MCP tools are having trouble recognizing them. The Memory Bank contains comprehensive documentation and progress tracking for the Memory Bank MCP project, which has been translated to English and configured for npm publication.
- [2025-03-08] - Standardized Memory Bank file naming pattern: Implemented a consistent kebab-case naming pattern for Memory Bank files. Changes include:

1. Updated CoreTemplates.ts to use kebab-case for file names
2. Simplified URI to filename mapping in MemoryBankResources.ts
3. Updated ProgressTracker.ts to use kebab-case file names
4. Created MigrationUtils.ts with a method to migrate existing files
5. Added a new migrate_file_naming tool to help users migrate existing Memory Banks
6. Created documentation in docs/file-naming-convention.md explaining the new convention
7. Added deleteFile method to FileUtils class

- [2025-03-08] - Decision Made: Memory Bank File Naming Pattern Standardization
- [2025-03-08] - Reviewed Memory Bank file naming pattern: Analyzed the current file naming pattern in the Memory Bank system. Found inconsistencies between the URI naming convention (kebab-case with hyphens) and the actual file naming convention (camelCase). This creates a mapping requirement in the code that could be simplified. Also identified that the file extensions are hardcoded as .md throughout the codebase.
- [2025-03-08] - Updated Memory Bank to English: Translated all Memory Bank files to English, ensuring consistency across the project. The following changes were made:

1. Translated the "Configuração para uso via npx" entry in the decision log to "Configuration for npx usage"
2. Translated the "Implementado suporte para npx" entry in the progress file to "Implemented npx support"
3. Updated all task descriptions and next steps in the active context file to English
4. Ensured all Memory Bank files use consistent English terminology

- [2025-03-08] - Translated files to English: Translated all generated files to English, including:

1. docs/npx-usage.md - Full translation of the documentation
2. src/index.ts - Translated help messages and comments
3. package.json - Translated package description

- [2025-03-08] - Decision Made: Configuration for npx usage
- [2025-03-08] - Implemented npx support: Added support to run Memory Bank MCP via npx after npm publication. Changes include:

1. Added bin configuration in package.json
2. Verified shebang in main file
3. Added prepublishOnly script to ensure build is run before publication
4. Updated .npmignore to exclude unnecessary files
5. Added support for --help option
6. Updated documentation (README.md and docs/npx-usage.md)
7. Specified minimum Node.js version

- [2025-03-08] - Translation to English: Translated Memory Bank files to English. The following changes were made:

1. Updated activeContext.md to use English for all content
2. Updated progress.md to use English for all content
3. Verified that other Memory Bank files (decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md) were already in English
4. Verified that README.md sections were updated to English

All project documentation and Memory Bank files are now consistently in English, which aligns with the project's development guidelines that specify "All code and documentation should be in English".

- [2025-03-08] - Project Configuration for npm Publication: Configured the project to be an open source package with versioning and publication via npm using GitHub Actions. The following changes were made:

1. Updated package.json with information needed for publication
2. Created a .npmignore file
