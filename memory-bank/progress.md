# Memory Bank MCP Progress

## Project Overview

Memory Bank MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools and resources for managing memory banks. It allows AI assistants to store and retrieve information across sessions.

## Update History

- [2025-03-08] - Translation to English: Translated Memory Bank files to English. The following changes were made:

1. Updated activeContext.md to use English for all content
2. Updated progress.md to use English for all content
3. Verified that other Memory Bank files (decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md) were already in English
4. Verified that README.md sections were updated to English

All project documentation and Memory Bank files are now consistently in English, which aligns with the project's development guidelines that specify "All code and documentation should be in English".

- [2025-03-08] - Project Configuration for npm Publication: Configured the project to be an open source package with versioning and publication via npm using GitHub Actions. The following changes were made:

1. Updated package.json with information needed for publication
2. Created a .npmignore file
3. Created a LICENSE file with the MIT license
4. Configured GitHub Actions for automatic npm publication
5. Configured GitHub Actions for tests
6. Created CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md files
7. Updated README.md with badges and contribution information
8. Configured tsconfig.json to generate type declarations
9. Updated the build script to correctly generate types

- [2025-03-08] - File Update: Updated documentation-structure.md
- [2025-03-08] - Decision Made: Documentation Structure Consolidation
- [2025-03-08] - Documentation Consolidation: Consolidated all documentation into a single docs directory. Previously, documentation was split between the main docs directory and memory-bank/docs. Now all documentation is organized in a single location with a comprehensive README.md that categorizes the documentation files into Core Documentation, Usage Documentation, and Integration Documentation. Updated the main README.md to reference the consolidated documentation directory.
- [2025-03-08] - File Update: Updated docs/README.md
- [2025-03-08] - Decision Made: AI Assistant Integration Documentation
- [2025-03-08] - AI Assistant Integration Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation for integrating Memory Bank MCP with AI assistants that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Added three new documentation files: (1) ai-assistant-integration.md with detailed integration methods and examples, (2) integration-testing-guide.md with step-by-step testing instructions and sample code, and (3) mcp-protocol-specification.md with a complete specification of the Memory Bank MCP protocol. These documents provide developers with all the information needed to integrate Memory Bank MCP with various AI assistants.
