# Active Context

## Current Project State

Memory Bank MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools and resources for managing memory banks. The code has been translated to English and improved with better error handling, more robust documentation, and additional utility methods. The build process has been configured to use Bun for improved performance. The project has been renamed from "memory-bank-server" to "@movibe/memory-bank-mcp" to follow npm scoped package naming conventions. Automated tests have been implemented for the clinerules integration using Bun's test runner.

## Current Session Notes

- Documentation Translation: Translated all documentation files to English and organized them in the docs folder. Created English versions of: usage-modes.md (from modos-de-uso.md), rule-examples.md (from exemplos-de-regras.md), roo-code-integration.md (from integracao-roo-code.md), rule-formats.md, implementation-plan-rule-formats.md, and a README.md index file for the documentation. All files are now properly organized in the memory-bank/docs directory.
- File Update: Updated docs/usage-modes.md
- File Update: Updated docs/implementation-plan-rule-formats.md
- File Update: Updated docs/rule-formats.md
- File Update: Updated docs/roo-code-integration.md
- File Update: Updated docs/rule-examples.md
- File Update: Updated docs/README.md
- File Update: Updated testing-strategy.md
- File Update: Updated test-coverage.md
- Decision Made: Test Framework Selection
- Test Implementation: Added comprehensive automated tests for the project, significantly improving test coverage from 56.01% to 91.37% of lines and from 59.31% to 94.18% of functions. Implemented tests for FileUtils, MemoryBankManager, ProgressTracker, and enhanced the existing clinerules integration tests.

## Ongoing Tasks

- Implement additional tests to reach 100% coverage
- Fix linter errors in progressTracker.test.ts
- Add integration tests for complete workflows
- Configure CI/CD for automated testing

## Known Issues

- Some linter errors in progressTracker.test.ts related to missing toContain method
- Remaining uncovered code in MemoryBankManager.ts (80.18% coverage)
- Remaining uncovered code in ExternalRulesLoader.ts (79.71% coverage)
- Remaining uncovered code in FileUtils.ts (83.02% coverage)

## Next Steps

- Implement tests for remaining uncovered code in MemoryBankManager.ts
- Implement tests for remaining uncovered code in ExternalRulesLoader.ts
- Implement tests for remaining uncovered code in FileUtils.ts
- Fix linter errors in progressTracker.test.ts
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
