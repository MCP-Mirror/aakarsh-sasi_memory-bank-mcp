# Active Context

## Current Project State

Memory Bank MCP is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides tools and resources for managing memory banks. The code has been translated to English and improved with better error handling, more robust documentation, and additional utility methods. The build process has been configured to use Bun for improved performance. The project has been renamed from "memory-bank-server" to "@movibe/memory-bank-mcp" to follow npm scoped package naming conventions. Automated tests have been implemented for the clinerules integration using Bun's test runner. The package has been successfully published to npm and is available for global installation.

## Current Session Notes

- [6:16:23 PM] [@movibe] Documentation: Created documentation on the English language policy for Memory Bank and reinforced the English-only requirement in the code with additional comments and warnings.
- [6:16:20 PM] [@movibe] File Update: Updated docs/english-language-policy.md
- [6:13:32 PM] [@movibe] Correção de Bug: Corrigido o problema onde os arquivos do Memory Bank estavam sendo criados na raiz do projeto em vez de usar o diretório + nome da pasta. Modificados os métodos setCustomPath, findMemoryBankDir e initializeMemoryBank para combinar o caminho base com o folderName.
- [6:13:29 PM] [@movibe] Decision Made: Correção do caminho do Memory Bank para usar folderName
- [5:26:20 PM] [@movibe] Updated Memory Bank Documentation: Updated the Memory Bank Structure section in system-patterns.md to reflect the correct file naming convention (kebab-case). Changed references from camelCase (productContext.md, activeContext.md, decisionLog.md, systemPatterns.md) to kebab-case (product-context.md, active-context.md, decision-log.md, system-patterns.md) to match the actual file names used in the Memory Bank.
- [5:23:30 PM] [@movibe] Decision Made: Memory Bank Directory Structure Simplification
- [5:23:24 PM] [@movibe] Fixed Memory Bank Directory Structure: Fixed the Memory Bank initialization to prevent creation of unnecessary subdirectories and duplicate files. The function initializeMemoryBank was creating subdirectories (progress, decisions, context, templates, backups, modes) and placing files in those subdirectories, but the rest of the code expected the files to be in the root directory of the Memory Bank. Modified the function to create all core files directly in the root directory, which is consistent with how the files are accessed throughout the codebase. Removed all duplicate directories and files that were previously created.
- [5:19:09 PM] [@movibe] Removed Environment Variables Support: Removed all support for environment variables from the codebase and documentation. This included removing references to MEMORY_BANK_PROJECT_PATH, MEMORY_BANK_FOLDER_NAME, MEMORY_BANK_MODE, and MEMORY_BANK_USER_ID from the code and documentation. Updated the README.md, custom-folder-name.md, and memory-bank-path-changes.md files to reflect this change. Removed the environment-variables.md documentation file. Removed the handleSetEnvironmentVariable function and its references from the codebase. This simplifies the configuration approach and makes the documentation clearer.
- [5:19:03 PM] [@movibe] Decision Made: Removal of Environment Variables Support
- [5:06:53 PM] [@movibe] Decision Made: Memory Bank Update Strategy
- [5:06:43 PM] [@movibe] Memory Bank Update: Updated the Memory Bank with the latest project status. Verified that all Memory Bank files (active-context.md, progress.md, decision-log.md, product-context.md, and system-patterns.md) are in English and contain comprehensive information about the project. The Memory Bank is properly initialized and configured in the specified directory (/Users/movibe/Documents/Cline/MCP/memory-bank-server/memory-bank). All recent improvements, including type safety enhancements, documentation updates, and bug fixes, are properly documented in the Memory Bank files.
- [12:31:42 PM] Memory Bank English Translation Completed: Completed the translation of all Memory Bank files to English by translating the "Next Steps" section in active-context.md. Now all Memory Bank files (active-context.md, progress.md, decision-log.md, product-context.md, and system-patterns.md) are fully in English, ensuring consistency across the project and aligning with the development guidelines.
- [12:30:57 PM] Memory Bank English Translation: Translated the remaining Portuguese content in the Memory Bank files to English. Updated the "Ongoing Tasks" and "Known Issues" sections in active-context.md and translated an entry in progress.md about documentation revision. This ensures all Memory Bank content is consistently in English, following the project's development guidelines.
- [12:29:47 PM] Documentation language policy updated: Updated the language policy for documentation: all files will be generated in English by default, unless specifically requested otherwise. Communication with the user will continue to be in Portuguese.
- [12:28:49 PM] Documentation updated: Translated all documentation files from Portuguese to English. The main consolidated document (cline-integration.md) and the redirection notes in the original documents (clinerules-auto-creation.md and clinerules-integration.md) are now in English.
- [12:09:30 PM] Memory Bank English Translation: Translated all Portuguese entries in the Memory Bank files to English. Updated active-context.md, progress.md, and decision-log.md to ensure all content is in English. This ensures consistency across all Memory Bank files and aligns with the project's development guidelines that specify all content should be in English.
- [12:07:42 PM] Decision Made: Approach for Type Safety Improvements
- [12:07:30 PM] Implemented advanced type safety improvements: Improved the test-tools.ts script to use the new interfaces and types we created, adding type validation and enhancing the code structure. Fixed linter errors related to how we're calling the callTool method. Added interfaces for test configuration, utility functions for sleep, and improved logging for easier debugging.
- [11:58:45 AM] Type Safety Verification: Verified the type safety improvements by running the build and tests. The build completed successfully, confirming that all type definitions are correct and there are no type errors. The tests also ran successfully with only one test failing due to an unrelated issue with file permissions. The implementation of discriminated union types, utility types, type-safe constants, and runtime type guards has been successfully integrated into the codebase without breaking existing functionality.
- [11:40:41 AM] Advanced Type Safety Implementation: Implemented comprehensive type safety improvements across the codebase. Created a structured type system with dedicated files for different domains: progress.ts for tracking-related types, rules.ts for rule-related types, utils.ts for utility types, constants.ts for type-safe constants, and guards.ts for runtime type validation. Implemented discriminated union types for progress details, utility types using TypeScript's type system features, type-safe constants with 'as const' assertions, and runtime type guards for validation. These improvements provide better type safety, improved IDE support, and runtime validation capabilities.
- [11:38:47 AM] Advanced Type Safety Improvements: Started implementing advanced type safety improvements as outlined in the updated code improvements document. Created a dedicated types directory structure with separate files for different domains (rules.ts, index.ts). Replaced 'any' types with specific interfaces and improved type definitions with proper JSDoc comments. Implemented a more organized approach to type exports to avoid circular dependencies. These changes make the code more maintainable, easier to understand, and less prone to runtime errors.
- [11:33:35 AM] Type Safety Improvements: Implemented type safety improvements as described in the code improvements document. Added detailed interfaces for data structures (ProgressDetails, Decision, ActiveContext, MemoryBankConfig, MemoryBankStatus, ModeState, ValidationResult) with proper JSDoc comments. Replaced generic 'any' types with specific interfaces and improved method signatures with more specific parameter and return types. Created a central types file to export all interfaces for use throughout the codebase. Updated methods to use these interfaces for better type safety.
- [11:27:31 AM] Memory Bank Files Translation: Updated all Memory Bank files to ensure they are in English. Translated Portuguese entries in active-context.md and progress.md to English, including recent updates about Memory Bank language configuration, error handling verification, and ongoing tasks. This ensures consistency across all Memory Bank files and aligns with the project's development guidelines that specify all content should be in English.
- [11:25:22 AM] Memory Bank English Update: Implemented improvements to ensure that the Memory Bank always uses English. Added a setLanguage method that always keeps the language as English, regardless of the parameter passed. Modified the constructor, initializeMemoryBank method, and setMemoryBankDir method to ensure that the language is always set to English. Also added more explicit comments in code files and templates to reinforce this design decision.
- [11:19:23 AM] Verification Completed: Analyzed step 2 of the code improvements document, focusing on error handling. Identified and documented the main improvements implemented, including try/catch blocks in file operations, descriptive error messages, proper error propagation, use of custom error classes, server error handling, error handling in tool handlers, graceful shutdown, existence checks, parameter validation, and specific error handling.
- [11:16:45 AM] Decision Made: Documentation of Memory Bank Status Prefix System
- [11:16:39 AM] Documentation Update: Added comprehensive documentation about the Memory Bank status prefix system. Created a new file docs/memory-bank-status-prefix.md with detailed information about the status indicators ([MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE], [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE], and [MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]), their meanings, implementation details, benefits, and troubleshooting. Updated the README.md with a new section about the status system. Updated docs/usage-modes.md to include information about the status prefix as a common feature across all modes. Added the new documentation file to the docs/README.md index.
- [11:05:55 AM] Decision Made: Clinerule Templates Format Standardization
- [11:05:48 AM] Updated Clinerule Templates: Updated the templates in ClineruleTemplates.ts to use YAML format instead of JSON. The new templates match the current .clinerules files used in the project, which include detailed instructions for Memory Bank management, mode collaboration, and UMB (Update Memory Bank) functionality. This ensures that when new .clinerules files are created, they will have the same format and functionality as the existing ones.
- [10:59:42 AM] Memory Bank Review: Reviewed the Memory Bank files and confirmed that all core files (active-context.md, decision-log.md, product-context.md, progress.md, system-patterns.md) are present and contain comprehensive information about the project. The Memory Bank is properly initialized and ready for use in the specified directory.
- [10:59:25 AM] Decision Made: Memory Bank Location
