# Rule File Examples in Different Formats

This document provides complete examples of rule files in JSON, YAML, and TOML formats for each of the modes supported by Memory Bank MCP. These examples are inspired by [Roo Code Memory Bank](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank) and adapted for Memory Bank MCP.
