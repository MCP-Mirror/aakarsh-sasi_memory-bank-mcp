\*\*\*\*# Memory Bank MCP Usage Modes

## Overview

Memory Bank MCP offers different operation modes inspired by [Roo Code Memory Bank](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank), allowing you to adapt the AI assistant's behavior for specific tasks. Each mode is configured through rule files (`.clinerules-[mode]`) that can be written in JSON, YAML, or TOML.

## Session Management

- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates**: Memory Bank is automatically synchronized with your work
- üíæ **Manual Updates**: Use "UMB" or "update memory bank" as a fallback when:
  - Ending a session unexpectedly
  - Halting a task midway
  - Recovering from connection issues
  - Forcing a full synchronization

## Creating Your Own Modes

You can create custom modes by creating `.clinerules-[your-mode]` files in JSON, YAML, or TOML. Follow the structure of the examples above and adapt them to your specific needs.
