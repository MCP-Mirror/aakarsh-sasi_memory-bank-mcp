# Custom Memory Bank Folder Name

## Overview

Memory Bank MCP now allows you to customize the name of the folder where the Memory Bank is stored. This feature provides greater flexibility for projects that may already have a `memory-bank` directory for other purposes or that want to use a different naming convention.

## Configuration Options

### Command Line Option

You can specify a custom folder name using the `--folder` or `-f` command line option:

```bash
# Use a custom folder name
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --folder custom-memory

# Combine with other options
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --path /path/to/project --folder custom-memory --mode code
```

### Environment Variable

You can also set the folder name using the `MEMORY_BANK_FOLDER_NAME` environment variable:

```bash
# Set the environment variable
export MEMORY_BANK_FOLDER_NAME=custom-memory

# Run Memory Bank MCP
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp
```

### Default Value

If no folder name is specified, Memory Bank MCP will use `memory-bank` as the default folder name.

## How It Works

When you specify a custom folder name, Memory Bank MCP will:

1. Create the Memory Bank in `<project_path>/<folder_name>` when initializing a new Memory Bank
2. Look for an existing Memory Bank in `<project_path>/<folder_name>` when setting a custom path
3. Use the specified folder name for all operations that involve the Memory Bank directory

## Examples

### Using a Custom Folder Name

```bash
# Initialize a Memory Bank with a custom folder name
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --folder my-memory-bank initialize_memory_bank path=.

# This will create the Memory Bank in ./my-memory-bank
```

### Using Different Folder Names for Different Projects

```bash
# Project 1
cd /path/to/project1
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --folder project1-memory initialize_memory_bank path=.

# Project 2
cd /path/to/project2
npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --folder project2-memory initialize_memory_bank path=.
```

### Using with MCP Tools

When using MCP tools, the custom folder name will be automatically used:

```
/mcp memory-bank-mcp initialize_memory_bank path=.
```

If you've started the Memory Bank MCP server with a custom folder name, the above command will create the Memory Bank in the specified folder.

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Use any folder name that fits your project's naming conventions
- **Compatibility**: Avoid conflicts with existing directories
- **Organization**: Use different folder names for different types of Memory Banks
- **Clarity**: Choose descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the Memory Bank

## Limitations

- Once a Memory Bank is initialized with a specific folder name, you should continue using the same folder name for that Memory Bank
- Changing the folder name after initialization will not automatically migrate existing Memory Bank files
- The folder name is applied globally to all Memory Bank operations during a session

## Best Practices

- Choose a descriptive folder name that reflects the purpose of the Memory Bank
- Use consistent folder names across related projects
- Document the folder name used for each project to ensure consistency
- Consider using environment variables in CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent folder names across environments
