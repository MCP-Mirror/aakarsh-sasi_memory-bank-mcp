# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Memory Bank MCP project.

## Testing Approach

The Memory Bank MCP project follows a comprehensive testing approach that includes:

1. **Unit Testing**: Testing individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Testing the interaction between components
3. **Error Handling Testing**: Testing how the system handles error conditions
4. **Edge Case Testing**: Testing boundary conditions and unusual scenarios

## Testing Framework

The project uses **Bun's built-in test runner** for all tests. This decision was made to:

- Leverage Bun's speed and efficiency
- Maintain consistency with the build tooling
- Simplify the development environment
- Reduce dependencies

## Test Organization

Tests are organized in the `src/__tests__` directory, with test files named according to the component they test:

- `fileUtils.test.ts`: Tests for the FileUtils class
- `memoryBankManager.test.ts`: Tests for the MemoryBankManager class
- `progressTracker.test.ts`: Tests for the ProgressTracker class
- `clinerules-integration.test.ts`: Tests for the clinerules integration

## Test Patterns

### Setup and Teardown

Each test file uses `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks to:

1. Create temporary test directories
2. Initialize test objects
3. Clean up after tests

Example:

```typescript
beforeEach(async () => {
  // Create temporary directory
  await fs.ensureDir(tempDir);
  
  // Initialize test objects
  testObject = new TestClass();
});

afterEach(async () => {
  // Clean up
  await fs.remove(tempDir);
});
```

### Asynchronous Testing

Asynchronous operations are tested using async/await:

```typescript
test('Should perform async operation', async () => {
  const result = await asyncOperation();
  expect(result).toBe(expectedValue);
});
```

### Event Testing

Events are tested using promises:

```typescript
test('Should emit event', async () => {
  return new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    emitter.on('event', (data) => {
      expect(data).toBe(expectedValue);
      resolve();
    });
    
    emitter.emit('event', value);
  });
});
```

### Error Testing

Error conditions are tested using try/catch blocks:

```typescript
test('Should handle errors', async () => {
  try {
    await operationThatShouldFail();
    // Should not reach here
    expect(true).toBe(false);
  } catch (error) {
    expect(error).toBeTruthy();
  }
});
```

## Running Tests

To run all tests:

```bash
bun test
```

To run tests with coverage:

```bash
bun test --coverage
```

To run a specific test file:

```bash
bun test src/__tests__/fileUtils.test.ts
```

## Coverage Goals

The project aims for:

- **Function Coverage**: 95%+
- **Line Coverage**: 90%+

## Continuous Integration

Future plans include setting up a CI/CD pipeline to:

1. Run tests automatically on each commit
2. Generate coverage reports
3. Fail builds if coverage drops below thresholds
4. Ensure all tests pass before merging changes

## Test Maintenance

Tests should be maintained alongside code changes:

1. When adding new features, add corresponding tests
2. When fixing bugs, add regression tests
3. When refactoring code, update affected tests
4. Regularly review and improve test coverage
