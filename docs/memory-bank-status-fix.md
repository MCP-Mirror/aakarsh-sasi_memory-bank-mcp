# Memory Bank Status Fix

## Overview

This document describes the issue with Memory Bank status detection and the changes made to fix it.

## Issue Description

The Memory Bank MCP server was correctly finding the Memory Bank directory but was not properly setting its status to "ACTIVE". This was causing the status prefix in responses to show as "[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]" even when a valid Memory Bank was present.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `isMemoryBank` method, which was using the `files.includes(file)` check to determine if a core file existed. This approach was not reliable because it was checking if the filename was included in the array of filenames returned by `FileUtils.listFiles()`. In some cases, this check was failing even when the files actually existed.

## Changes Made

1. **Modified `isMemoryBank` Method**:

   - Changed the approach to check for each core file individually using `FileUtils.fileExists()` instead of relying on the list of files returned by `FileUtils.listFiles()`.
   - This ensures that each file is checked directly, which is more reliable.

2. **Enhanced `setCustomPath` Method**:

   - Added an explicit call to `updateMemoryBankStatus()` after setting the Memory Bank directory.
   - This ensures that the status is updated immediately after finding a valid Memory Bank.

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added better error handling in the `initializeModeManager` method.
   - Ensured that errors are properly logged and propagated.

## Testing

The changes were tested by running the server and verifying that:

1. The Memory Bank is correctly detected
2. The status is set to "ACTIVE" when a valid Memory Bank is found
3. The status prefix in responses shows as "[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]"

## Benefits

These changes improve the reliability of Memory Bank status detection, ensuring that the server correctly identifies and uses existing Memory Banks. This leads to a better user experience, as the status prefix in responses accurately reflects the state of the Memory Bank.
