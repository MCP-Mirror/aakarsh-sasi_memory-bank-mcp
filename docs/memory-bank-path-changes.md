# Memory Bank Path Changes

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to the Memory Bank initialization and path handling in the MCP (Memory Control Panel) system. The changes ensure that the Memory Bank is always created in a standardized location and that the necessary configuration files are present.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Standardized Memory Bank Location

- The Memory Bank is now **always** created in a directory named `memory-bank` at the root of the current project.
- Custom paths are no longer supported for Memory Bank initialization.
- The `findMemoryBankDir` method now only looks for the Memory Bank in the current directory, not in subdirectories.

### 2. Validation of .clinerules Files

- The system now validates that all required `.clinerules` files exist in the project root before initializing a Memory Bank.
- Required files:
  - `.clinerules-architect`
  - `.clinerules-ask`
  - `.clinerules-code`
  - `.clinerules-debug`
  - `.clinerules-test`
- If any of these files are missing, the initialization will fail with an error message listing the missing files.

## Implementation Details

### MemoryBankManager Changes

- Modified `findMemoryBankDir` to only look in the current directory
- Added `validateClinerules` method to check for required .clinerules files
- Updated `initializeMemoryBank` to validate .clinerules files and always create the Memory Bank in the current directory
- Modified `initializeModeManager` to validate .clinerules files before initializing the mode manager

### ExternalRulesLoader Changes

- Added `validateRequiredFiles` method to check for required .clinerules files
- Updated `detectAndLoadRules` to validate required files before loading rules

### CoreTools Changes

- Modified `handleInitializeMemoryBank` to always use the current directory
- Modified `handleSetMemoryBankPath` to always use the current directory

## Testing

A new test file `memory-bank-validation.test.ts` was created to verify:

1. The validation of .clinerules files works correctly
2. The Memory Bank is always created in the current directory
3. The system fails gracefully when required files are missing

## Usage Impact

### For Users

- Memory Bank will always be created in a `memory-bank` directory at the root of the current project
- All required .clinerules files must be present in the project root

### For Developers

- No need to handle custom paths for Memory Bank initialization
- Always validate that required .clinerules files exist before initializing a Memory Bank
- Always use the current directory as the root for Memory Bank operations
