# Bun Migration

## Overview

This document describes the process of migrating the Memory Bank Server to the Bun runtime, replacing traditional Node.js.

## Motivation

The migration to Bun was motivated by the following factors:

- Better performance and faster startup
- Compatibility with existing npm packages
- Integrated tools (bundler, test runner, etc.)
- Native TypeScript support
- Simplified configuration

## Migration Steps

### 1. Bun Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 2. Project Configuration

- Creation of `bunfig.toml` file with Bun-specific configurations
- Update of `package.json` to use Bun scripts
- Adjustment of `tsconfig.json` for Bun compatibility

### 3. Code Adaptation

- Verification of compatibility for all dependencies
- Adjustment of imports and exports to ESM format
- Update of Node.js-specific APIs to Bun equivalents

### 4. Script Updates

- `build`: Utilization of Bun's integrated bundler
- `start`: Direct execution with Bun
- `dev`: Development mode with hot reload

## Current Configuration

The `bunfig.toml` file contains the following configurations:

```toml
[install]
# Use the default npm registry
registry = "https://registry.npmjs.org/"

[build]
# Build configurations
target = "node"
minify = true
sourcemap = "external"

[dev]
# Development configurations
hot = true
```

## Observed Benefits

- Faster server startup
- Better I/O operation performance
- Faster build process
- More agile development with hot reload

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Dependency Compatibility**: Some dependencies may not be fully compatible with Bun. Solution: Check for alternatives or use polyfills when necessary.
- **API Differences**: Some Node.js APIs may have different behaviors in Bun. Solution: Consult Bun documentation and adapt code as needed.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers may not be familiar with Bun. Solution: Clear documentation and usage examples.

## Next Steps

- Explore advanced Bun features (such as the integrated SQLite database)
- Further optimize the build process
- Implement automated tests using Bun's test runner
