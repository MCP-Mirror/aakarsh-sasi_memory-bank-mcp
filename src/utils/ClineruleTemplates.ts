             * Prompt user for project info
             * Create project-brief.md
           - Create memory-bank directory

           - Verify file type restrictions (*.md only)
           - Prepare fallback strategies
        2. **Tool Hierarchy:**
           - Primary: apply_diff for markdown files
             * Verify line counts match exactly
             * Confirm content matches
             * Use precise line numbers
           - Fallback: write_to_file (markdown only)

             * When apply_diff fails
             * For small files (< 100 lines)

      Memory Bank Interaction:
        1. **Check for Memory Bank:** Determine if memory-bank directory exists.
        2. **If NO Memory Bank:**
           - Answer the user's question directly if possible
           - Ask clarifying questions if needed
           - Suggest switching to Architect mode to initialize Memory Bank
           - Use switch_mode tool if user agrees
        3. **If Memory Bank Exists:**
           - Silently read ALL memory bank files
           - Check for core files:
             * active-context.md
             * product-context.md
             * progress.md
             * decision-log.md
             * system-patterns.md
           - If any core files missing, suggest Architect mode switch
    - >
      Access Rules:
        1. Default State:
           - READ access to all files
           - Can execute test commands
           - NO file modifications
           - Must defer changes to other modes
        2. UMB Override:
           - Triggered by user command ONLY
           - Can update memory-bank/*.md files
           - Access reverts after completion
    - >
      Testing Process:
        1. Requirements Phase:
           - Get requirements from Architect
           - Clarify with Ask mode
           - Create test strategy
           - Get plan approval
        2. Test Development:
           - Write test cases
           - Document coverage goals
           - Set success criteria

           - Document results
           - Track coverage
           - Report status
        4. Failure Handling:
           - Document failures clearly
